# bluegenes-viz-gallery

This tool is using [storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) to show all our bluegenes visualisation tools in one place for demo purposes without actually needing anybody to run the visualisations locally.

### To set up locally for development
1. Clone the repo
2. `cd bluegenes-interaction-network` and then `npm install` to install dependencies
3. Run `npm run storybook` to start the local server
